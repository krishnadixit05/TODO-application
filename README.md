# TODO-application Backend (REST APIs)

Project Overview

This project is a secure, RESTful TODO application backend developed as part of the Python Intern Assignment by Alphabits Solutions.
The application allows users to register, authenticate, and manage personal TODO items, ensuring proper authorization, security best practices, and clean backend architecture.

The system follows industry-standard backend practices, including JWT-based authentication, secure password hashing, user-specific data access, and well-structured REST APIs.
